* ATLAS OS

#+HTML: <img src="./assets/main.jpeg">

In honor of [[https:atlasdev.club][ATLAS]] 

I use =stow= to manage my dotfiles. I've structured things such that everything is symlinked to =.config= with one command:

#+begin_src sh
stow .
#+end_src

Feel free to clone this repo and modify as needed.
