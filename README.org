* MATERIAL ME

[[file:./assets/main.jpeg]]

I use =stow= to manage my dotfiles. I've structured things such that everything is symlinked to =.config= with one command:

#+begin_src sh
stow .
#+end_src

This rice syncs my colourscheme with my [website](https://adithyanair.com)

Feel free to clone this repo and modify as needed.
** Making the wallpaper
#+begin_src 
exec ./.config/wallpaper/matugen.sh
#+end_src
